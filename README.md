## Hello👋
I am <i>Adrian</i>, a web developer based in Germany.

I try to build whateever comes into my mind...and probably end up shelving my ideas halfway because of better ideas.
In my private time, I mainly work on smaller projects and Quality of Life extensions for web browsers, even though I have bigger ideas...but not the time.
These ideas are often connected to my hobbies or games I play.

My main tech stack is React + Typescript + Tailwind. Through work experience, I have advanced knowledge of working with Ubuntu-based servers, scripting in Siemens Polarion and therefore know my way around Velocity Template language as well.

I don't have many public repos, but starting this Readme is also a way to start working more regularly on these big ideas I mentioned above - with public repos.
